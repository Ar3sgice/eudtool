This is an EUD tool made 10 years ago, at which time people were doing EUD for starcraft v1.08
Only changed offsets to 1.16/remastered based on http://farty1billion.dyndns.org/EUDDB/

Basic usage:
- click the "v" button to calculate memory and generate trigger
- click the "v" button to the right to expand the help area

Option "use MaskedMemory":
if checked, it uses "Masked MemoryAddr" trigger which works only on remastered
otherwise, it uses normal trigger with Add/Subtract which will need original values

Setting an address to a string:
- put "string" (with "") in Value input

Setting an address to a hexstring:
- put 'hex' (with '') in Value input
- hex must not have spaces

Buttons:
- since writing the original buttons memory region often causes conflicts with other units, here we put new buttons at offset 0x590000 (an unused section) and direct pointers to them
- each button takes 20 bytes of memory (the 8 fields)
- set "Unit Buttons - Total Buttons" to number of buttons
- set "Unit Buttons - Button Offset" to 0x590000 + 20 * (button object ID)

However, for the buttons to actually work, "Requirements" is also needed
- set the requirement corresponding to "Act Function" and "Act Variable"
- value <ID> 00 FF FF gives free requirement (all units can use it)
- ex: firebat (unit 32) write address 0x51420C of 0xFFFF0020 (20 00 ff ff)
- then every building can make firebat if had the buttons
- also you can set each opcode to all "must be broodwar" or things like that
- might make a requirement opcode parser if I'm really bored to that level
- also there is a pointer to requirement offset in the dat files, it shows up as 65535 in datedit but ingame it is set to half the offset from the requirement header

Option "IceCC parser":
- iscript doesn't work on remastered, but the parser works pretty nice so i kept it here
- better only parse iscripts of units you edit (from .headerstart until next unit), not the entire script

Option "Stat_txt.tbl Edits":
- you have to edit 2 strings at the same time
- you can use color codes like it's in SCMDraft

- first generate CPT triggers
- it defaults to condition switch 164, make sure you set it
- then generate each string edit section
- fill in the PUT STRING EDITS HERE section

- it uses "CP Trick" to edit the dynamic (?) pointer memory
- 2 strings same time for there is no "Masked Set CurrentPlayer Deaths"
- personally I think it's not really dynamic since it's a simulator anyways
- my address is 0x19184660 tell me if yours is different
- and don't rename your marines

Others:
- I understand that no one plays this game anymore. I program only for my own entertainment and feeling of accomplishment
- In other words I was terribly bored
