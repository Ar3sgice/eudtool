Weapon damage type, against each unit size

struct {
int id;
int multipliers[4]; // independant = 0, small = 1, medium = 2, large = 3
} dmgMultiplier;

dmgMultiplier weaponDamageTypes[5]; // Independent, Explosive, Concussive, Normal, Ignore Armor

Values are represented as a fraction of 256, so 256 = 100% damage, 512 = 200% damage, 64 = 25% damage.

The minimum amount of damage able to be done is 0.5, so a 0 multiplier means any attack will do .5 damage. Independent is the the unit size used for powerups
such as data disc, and hence this is why they take 0.5 damage from each hit and take a long time to kill.

Weapon factor is applied after subtracting unit armor from the weapon's damage.
